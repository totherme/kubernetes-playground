# A kubernetes playground

(forked from the [runc one](https://github.com/totherme/runc-playground))

Want to play with k8s?

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Then follow instructions from the [dev guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/development.md)

## TODO:
rsync scripts so you can dev outside the vagrant box, and build inside
